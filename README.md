# Overview

This project is focused on strengthening foundational skills in software development by initializing and managing a code repository on GitHub. The objective is to gain experience in version control and to practice good coding practices with a simple "Hello, World!" program.

This software is a basic "Hello, World!" application written in Python, designed as an introductory project for working with GitHub repositories and demonstrating familiarity with Python's core syntax.

The purpose of this software is to set up a repository with an initial program that serves as a starting point for more complex projects. This exercise helps me become more comfortable with GitHub workflows and basic Python programming.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used the following tools:
- **GitHub** for version control and repository hosting
- **Visual Studio Code** as the code editor
- **Python 3.11.4** as the programming language, ideal for a simple "Hello, World!" application due to its readability and popularity in the programming community
